IS BETTERNever ever administered 
antibiotics or growth hormones, 
our Grass Fed Beef is raised on 
100% non-GMO grass pastures. 
Meat from cattle raised on grass 
contains lower totals of saturated 
and mono-saturated fat, and 
it has higher levels of heart 
healthy omega-3 fatty acids, 
beta-carotene, and B vitamins. 
Plus, this well-managed grazing 
naturally supports soil fertility, 
which reduces erosion and water 
pollution. What's not to love
